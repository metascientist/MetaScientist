## Overview

MetaScientist is a human-AI synergistic framework for automated mechanical metamaterial design. This repository contains the demo interface for the MetaScientist system, allowing users to interact with the framework through a web-based application.

The system accelerates the design of novel metamaterials through two primary phases:
1. **Hypothesis Generation**: Performs complex reasoning to generate novel and scientifically sound hypotheses, supported by domain-specific foundation models and inductive biases retrieved from existing literature.
2. **3D Structure Synthesis**: Synthesizes 3D structures with a novel diffusion model based on textual hypotheses and refines them with an LLM-based refinement model to achieve better structural properties.

## Demo Interface

This repository contains only the frontend demo interface of the MetaScientist system. The backend code and models are not included in this public repository.
